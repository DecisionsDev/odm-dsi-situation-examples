## Decision Server Insights: Business situations \(experimental feature\)

This repository contains a description of a new experimental concept in IBM Operational Decision Manager V8.10.0 called "business situations" and includes a set of examples. Business situations aims to address some complex event processing \(CEP\) use cases.

Decision Server Insights tracks and analyzes \(processing\) information \(data\) about things that happen \(events\), and derives a conclusion from this data. Keeping data long enough to make the right decision is a CEP dilemma.

Business situations is a concept to identify, detect, and be notified of circumstances that are of special interest. It can keep the special data for longer time periods to counteract something harmful or undesirable, or take advantage of an opportunity.
